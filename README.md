# R-demos

This is a set of scripts demoing the use of different machine learning and statistical algorithms. The purpose is to build up a record of best practices around using these algorithms, error and accuracy checking, and plotting for my own reference. Its also a good example of what I can do! 

## ToDo 
### Add anonymized versions of 
- regression script and r markdown file
- dimensionality reduction with PCA
- dimensionality reduction with Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- clustering with k-means
#### Create demos of 
- random forest classification
- co-occurance matrix recommendation engine
